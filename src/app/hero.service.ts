/*  TIP °°° Services °°°
    Services are a great way to share information among classes that don't know each other. 
    You'll create a MessageService and inject it in two places:

    in HeroService which uses the service to send a message.
    in MessagesComponent which displays that message.

@Injectable()
export class HeroService {

  constructor() { }
